# Tank2
Tank2 is a fork of a game I created with two friend for an high school project.

This fork is intended to provide a more stable game and to try some machine learning algorithm.

## Dependencies
Python 3 is needed, with the following packages:
- pygame [https://github.com/pygame/pygame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)

```
pip install pygame
```

## Progression
* [x]Â Reimplement the game, as it was 
* [ ] Implement some ML algorithms

## Sound problem
Currently the sound option is disable because of a bug in pygame causing a CPU overuse ([https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/331](https://github.com/pygame/pygame/issues/331)). As it is supposed to be fix in pygame 2, I wait for it to be released.
